## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @thingsboard/n8n-nodes-thingsboard
```

### Configuration

1. Get your ThingsBoard credentials (URL, username, password)
2. In n8n, add ThingsBoard credentials:
   - **Base URL**: `https://demo.thingsboard.io`, `https://thingsboard.cloud` or your instance URL
   - **Username**: Your ThingsBoard login
   - **Password**: Your ThingsBoard password
3. Add the ThingsBoard node to your workflow
4. Select a resource (Device, Asset, etc.) and operation


## 📦 Installation

### GUI Installation

For self-hosted n8n instances, you can install directly via the web interface:

1. Open n8n in your browser
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Community Nodes**
3. Click **Install a community node**
4. Enter package name: `@thingsboard/n8n-nodes-thingsboard`
5. Click **Install**
6. Wait for installation to complete
7. Refresh your browser

**Note**: This method requires owner/admin permissions and is only available for self-hosted n8n (not n8n Cloud).

### n8n Cloud

The ThingsBoard node requires verification to be available on n8n Cloud. n8n Cloud supports a select group of verified community nodes included in their official catalog.

**Current Status**: Until the node is verified and included in the Cloud-available catalog, use self-hosted n8n (local or Docker) with any installation method above.

## 🔧 Verify Installation

After installation and restart:

1. Open n8n in your browser (typically `http://localhost:5678`)
2. Create a new workflow
3. Click the **+** button to add a node
4. Search for **"ThingsBoard"** in the node picker
5. The **ThingsBoard** node should appear in the search results

If you don't see the node:
- Verify the npm installation completed without errors
- Ensure you restarted n8n after installation (for Method 2)
- Check n8n logs for any loading errors

## 🔑 Setting Up Credentials

Before using the ThingsBoard node, configure your connection credentials:

1. In n8n, navigate to **Credentials** → **New Credential**
2. Search for **"ThingsBoard API"**
3. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Base URL** | ThingsBoard instance URL (without trailing slash) | `https://demo.thingsboard.io` or `https://thingsboard.cloud` |
| **Username** | Your ThingsBoard account email | `tenant@thingsboard.org` |
| **Password** | Your ThingsBoard account password | `tenant` |

4. Click **Save** to store the credentials

The credentials are encrypted and stored securely by n8n. You can reuse the same credentials across multiple ThingsBoard nodes in different workflows.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: 🤖 AI Agent Tool - Conversational IoT Control

Use the ThingsBoard node as a **tool for AI Agents** to enable intelligent, natural language IoT automation.

![AI Agent Use Case](images/ai-agent-usecase.png)

#### How it works

1. User sends a chat message: *"What devices do I have and what's their status?"*
2. AI Agent (powered by Google Gemini or OpenAI GPT-4) has access to ThingsBoard tools
3. Agent autonomously calls:
   - `Get devices in ThingsBoard` → Retrieves device list
   - `Get timeseries in ThingsBoard` → Fetches latest telemetry
4. Agent responds in natural language with the actual data

#### Natural language commands

- *"Show me the temperature of my living room sensor"*
- *"Which devices are offline right now?"*
- *"Update the threshold on device X to 30 degrees"*
- *"Send me an alert if any temperature exceeds 25°C"*

The AI agent understands context and calls the appropriate ThingsBoard operations automatically!

### Example 2: 💡 Daily Telemetry Export to AWS S3

**Real-world scenario**: Every night, export device telemetry to S3, but also enrich it with device metadata from your CRM, convert to Parquet format for Athena, and trigger a Lambda function to update your data warehouse. One workflow, multiple outputs.

**Why use n8n instead of ThingsBoard's native export**:
- **Multi-destination** - Send the same data to S3 + Snowflake + email report in one workflow
- **Data transformation** - Enrich telemetry with business context (customer names, locations from CRM)
- **Custom formats** - Convert to Parquet, Avro, or CSV with specific schemas for your analytics tools
- **Conditional logic** - Export only specific devices, filter by customer tier, or aggregate before storage
- **Integration chains** - After S3 upload → Trigger AWS Lambda → Update tracking database → Send Slack notification
